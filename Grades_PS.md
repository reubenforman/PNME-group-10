# Grades of the problem sets:
PS1: 8.25/10, great job.

PS2: 8.75/10. Excellent job.

PS3: 8.25, excellent

PS4: 7.5/10. Excellent. Note that when asked for the solution of an optimization you need to provide the vector of solutions x* (min/maximizing values of the choice variables). 

## PS5
7.75/10

(a) Good work, but I'd love to see you try to be more systematic. In (ii) you're
not plotting the sequence of points you actually used.  Don't you want to show
the progress of the algorithm?  In (iii) it's concerning t me that your
algorithm is not actually finding the true minimum, for any value of `b`.  Why
aren't you discussing this issue?  

(b) At the end, I'd like you to think through how you might check to verify that
you're actually getting the right solution when you move away from your test
case.  

(c) I like where you're going here with the comparison table!  Maybe try to go further?  Make the study more systematic by trying a bunch of possible starting values and calculating an average success rate or something like that?  

(d) You're not actually showing the results here.  I can sort of tell what you've found from the objective value, but that's not really sufficient.  Needs more discussion.

Overall: Good job, but you need to pay some more attention to the details.  I
think the discussion in part (a) is particularly disconnected from the results
you're getting, which suggests you may not really understand what's going on. 

## PS6: 8/10
- I like the animations!  You should probably keep the axes constant though throughout
- $f_3$ is unreadable -- don't go all the way down to zero for functions that blow up like this
- I'm not sure this approach to showing the optimal solution in Q2 is working.  Kind of hard to make sense of.  Choosing k' and c are equivalent in this case, so you really only need to plot one
- Otherwise, nicely done.  

PS7: 7.25/10 Nice effort!
- Q1: reported computation times seem quite high.  Can you improve it?
- The amount of noise here in the solutions is concerning -- are you failing to solve the optimization problem robustly?
- IRFs look strange, although you're finding roughly the right steady state
- Q2: good attempt, but it looks like things aren't quite working.  See my solutions.
